# Algorithm-PSIA

This repository contains the MATLAB coding of the PSIA algorithm, which is used to identify subnetworks in drug similarity network.


There are five MATLAB files in total: PSIA.m is the main coding for the PSIA algorithm; C01_4_548_1391_22_0.mat is the data of the input node-weighted graph; Function_OutputDegree.m is the function used to calculate the degrees of vertices; Function_prim.m is the function used to delete edges which are not in the same connected component with the terminals; Function_SMTpost.m is the function used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of the input graph.

To run PSIA, put all the five MATLAB files is the same document, and run PSIA.m.
